A collection of Dockerfiles for building images with recent C++ compilers built from sources,
which can be used e.g. in GitHub actions for testing code that requires recent C++ features.
See [hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dglaeser/compiler-images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dglaeser/compiler-images)
or the [actions](https://github.com/dglaeser/compiler-images/actions/) of this repository for the built images.
